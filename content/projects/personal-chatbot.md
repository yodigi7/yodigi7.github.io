# Building Chatbot Brilliance

At Perficient, my journey into the world of chatbot development began. But it's not just about answering questions; it's about crafting conversations that feel like you're chatting with a real person. Some queries require real-time data from our vast website, making it a bit like finding a needle in a haystack.

So, I embarked on a chatbot project that aimed higher than the usual Q&A. It aimed to replicate genuine human interactions. We teamed up the chatbot with a Large Language Model (LLM) and used tech wizardry like website content indexing and ChromaDB, a cool database. Thanks to the LLM, we could fetch and present information just like a seasoned customer service representative.

# Empowering Recruiters and Beyond

SvelteKit caught my attention as an intriguing frontend technology that I wanted to explore, making it an excellent opportunity for a learning experience. Inspired by my time at Perficient, I took an exciting turn. Why not apply chatbot magic to personal needs? This idea gave birth to a side project, tailor-made for helping recruiters. Recruiters often have questions hidden in my resume, but not everyone wants to sift through every detail. This chatbot empowers them to ask their burning questions and get speedy answers. With this vision, I ventured into implementation.

My time at Perficient fueled my innovation fire, pushing me to explore SvelteKit, an awesome tool for creating lightning-fast, SEO-friendly websites. After building the frontend foundation, I introduced the Llama2 LLM to the chatbot, even feeding it my resume. Now, it's primed to tackle any basic questions a recruiter throws its way.
