# This Website

This website is written with **Hugo** using the terminal theme with some custom html/css added.

I chose Hugo to write this because this site is static so no need to overcomplicate it with something like Angular or React.
I originally had a totally custom website hoster at [https://yodigi7.github.io/portfolio](https://yodigi7.github.io/portfolio) but I found out about Hugo recently and decided to use this as a learning opportunity.
It will allow me to easily add additional projects as I make them by just creating a new `.md` file and it will automatically take care of the rest for me.

This page was written very easily with simple markdown as shown [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yodigi7/yodigi7.github.io/main/content/projects/website.md).
