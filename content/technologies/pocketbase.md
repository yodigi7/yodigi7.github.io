# PocketBase: What Is It?

PocketBase is an open-source backend solution designed to streamline data management for businesses and developers alike. It offers a secure and scalable environment for storing, querying, and analyzing data, removing the complexities associated with traditional database systems.

It is a great free alternative to Firebase that is able to run locally as well as be deployed to the cloud as a production instance.

One thing to note is that it does use SQLite as the backend server that makes it a great all-in-one quick to get running setup that does well for anything from a prototype to a medium sized project.
