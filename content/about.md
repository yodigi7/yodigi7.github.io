# About Me

I am currently a consultant at Perficient in Saint Louis, MO, where I work with the AI National Business Unit serving clients across the United States.

I have extensive experience in leveraging cloud AI services, such as Google's Dialogflow and Form Parser/Document AI, to develop chatbots and automate document processing. Currently, my focus is on Large Language Models (LLMs), harnessing their power to generate and understand content.

One exciting application of LLMs is their ability to transform websites into virtual customer service representatives. By ingesting specific websites and enabling the AI to answer questions, we can reduce the workload of human customer service representatives, handling basic queries with up-to-date information and addressing long-tail questions not covered by traditional solutions like Dialogflow.

My passion lies in tackling challenging problems with no predefined solutions, which is what drew me to programming and AI. I'm deeply committed to what I do, dedicating time and energy to my side projects. These personal initiatives have allowed me to build a diverse skill set, as I've created numerous projects from scratch. Self-learning has been a cornerstone of my knowledge base, and I thrive on acquiring new skills independently.

I'm all about the joy of learning and helping others along the way. I genuinely adore the hands-on aspect of coding â€“ it's not just a job; it's my passion. My journey into software development started back in high school when I was self-taught. Looking back, I wished I had a mentor to guide me through those early days. Fortunately, I found some amazing mentors during college and my career who made a world of difference in my growth. Now, I'm eager to pay it forward by supporting newer developers on their own paths to success.
