# About Me

I am currently a consultant for Perficient in Saint Louis, MO.
I am working with the AI National Business Unit that works with customers across the United States.

I have worked on plenty of projects using cloud AI services such as Google's Dialogflow to build chatbots as well as Google's Form Parser/Document AI.
Currently working a lot with LLMs (large language models) to generate/understand content.
One common use case for generative models such as LLMs is being able to ingest a specific website for a company and then have it answer question as a customer service representative would do.
This is a very good solution that can take off the burden of human customer service representatives by having the AI field a lot of the more basic questions with up to date information.
It also is a good solution for answering the long-tail questions that have yet to be implemented into a solution such as Dialogflow.

My passion is with hard challenges with no predefined solution which is what brought me to programming but even more so AI.
I love what I do which is why I have plenty of time and energy to continue on my side projects.
This allows me to build my skillset since I have built many projects from the ground up on my own.
I have a lot of experience with learning new things on my own as that is how I built most of my knowledge base.
