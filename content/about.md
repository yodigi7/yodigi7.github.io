# About Me

I am currently a consultant for Perficient in Saint Louis, MO.
I am working with the AI National Business Unit that works with customers across the country.
My passion is with hard challenges with no predefined solution which is what brought me to programming but even more so AI.
I love what I do which is why I have plenty of time and energy to continue on my side projects.
This allows me to build my skillset since I have built many projects from the ground up on my own.
I have a lot of experience with learning new things on my own as that is how I built ~80% of my knowledge base.
